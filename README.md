# What is an Web Application Firewall?
- A cloud-native web application firewall (WAF) service that protects web apps from common web-hacking techniques such as SQL injection and security vulnerabilities such as cross-site scripting. 
- Admins can deploy the service in minutes to get complete visibility into your environment and block malicious attacks.
- A WAF solution can react to a security threat faster by centrally patching a known vulnerability, instead of securing each individual web application.

- WAF sits between external users and web applications to analyze all HTTP communication.
- WAFs secure business-critical web applications and web servers from zero-day threats and other application-layer attacks.

# Network Firewall
- Network Firewall protects a secured local-area network from unauthorized access to prevent the risk of attacks.
