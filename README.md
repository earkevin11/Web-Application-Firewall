# Web-Application-Firewall

# What is an Web Application Firewall?
- A cloud-native web application firewall (WAF) service that protects web apps from common web-hacking techniques such as SQL injection and security vulnerabilities such as cross-site scripting. 
- Admins can deploy the service in minutes to get complete visibility into your environment and block malicious attacks.
- A WAF solution can react to a security threat faster by centrally patching a known vulnerability, instead of securing each individual web application.
